# Resource Manager Web App

The goal of this project is to create a web application for community curated web development, and general programming resources. The finished app should allow for users to sign up, submit resources, create their own bespoke "My Resources" lists from the submitted content.

The project will be built with Node.js/Express.js as the back-end and MongoDB as the database solution.

I have chosen these simply because I am currently learning both.

## To-Do:

* Mobile styling
* Edit personal details page for users
* Format HTML for email verification
* User password reset link + functionality
* Build pages/routes for edge cases: eg 404, user trying to make GET requests to POST routes
* Amend User model to include user permission levels eg "user", "admin"
* Build out admin permissions to delete content
