# Resource Manager Web App

The goal of this project is to create a web application for community curated web development, and general programming resources. The finished app should allow for users to sign up, submit resources, create their own bespoke "My Resources" lists from the submitted content.

The project will be built with Node.js as the back-end and MongoDB as the database solution.

I have chosen these simply because I am currently learning both.

## This README file will be further populated at a later stage, as the project is currently simply conceptual, with minimal architecture in place.
